Choqué

Don't recognise the reflection
in the wing mirror anymore
the faster you drive
the sooner we break

leave the car running

I feel the safety belt choking me
the passengers seat swallows me up
the passengers seat swallows me up

leave the car running
will leave the car running?
please leave the car running...
