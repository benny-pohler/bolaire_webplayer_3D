Sincérité

Run a scalpel through my skin
I’m ready to be cut wide open
Rummage out my entrails
and take what you like
until you find what you need

Put my brittle bones together
into a skeleton solid and stout
rearranging every part of myself
so that nothing remains
where it used to belong

Lying stark naked ashore
taking apart my whole body 
Until I can finally adore 
who I became today

Take my thoughts and secrets
Make a mosaic out of them
I want nothing to ever
stay the same again
