Réunion

Merging with the wallpaper
in your dusty living room
to maybe get the feeling
I belong here

Becoming furniture
wearing the lampshade
until you find a place for me
to stay

take the space above my head
there is no need for me to grow
fill the room around us
Don’t need space for me

Don’t need space for me
There is no space for me
